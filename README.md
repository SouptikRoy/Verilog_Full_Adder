# Verilog_Full_Adder
Project Overview  This project implements a 1-bit Full Adder circuit using Verilog HDL, which performs binary addition of three input bits — two significant bits (A, B) and a carry-in (Cin) — to produce a sum (S) and a carry-out (Cout). The Full Adder is a core building block of digital arithmetic circuits such as adders, ALUs, and CPUs.
